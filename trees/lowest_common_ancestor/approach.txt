The level 0 solution is to just follow the nodes up from each child (and keep track of what we find) to find where they converge.
Since we are in a binary tree, I think that we can be a bit more efficient.
One child will always be smaller than the other, so we can write an algorithm that walks the tree until we finda value that is in between our two children.  This Node will always be an ancestor of both.
