Write a program that does a pre-order traversal from a given (unbalanced) binary tree.


A pre-order traversal is when you start at the root and go clockwise, sticking to the edges, printing out each node's value as you encounter it.



Consider the following tree:

       100
      /   \
    50    150
   / \    /  \
  25  75 125  175
        /
      110


The preorder traversal would be 100, 50, 25, 75, 150, 125, 110, 175
