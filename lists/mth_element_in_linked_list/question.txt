Given a singly linked list, devise a time- and space-efficient algorithm to find the mth-to-last element of the list. Implement your algorithm, taking care to handle relevant error conditions. Define mth to last such that when m = 0 the last element of the list is returned.


Editor's note: Since this is a derivative question, I've copied the base linked list implementation code that I used in the "linked_list" folder to here.
